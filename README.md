# US-Gun-Data-Analysis
## by Marko Schmidt


## Dataset

This analysis is about Gun sales und background checks in the US. In particular we will try to find trends for the development of gun sales in comparison with census data.

It attempts to answer the following questions:

What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?
Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations?
What is the overall trend of gun purchases?

## Summary of Findings

Question 1: What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?
Data shows that gun per capita 2016 raised 1,9 to 4,9 gun per capita compared to 3 gun per capita in 2010. There seems to be a trend for people in the US to by more guns in 2016 than they did 2010.

Question 2: Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations?
After calculating the growth rate for all states data shows that Indiana with an overal growth rate of 315,7% has the highest growth in gun registration amoung all states.

Question 3: What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
Due to the fact that only Utah sold less guns 2016 than 2010, all other states sold more guns in 2016 that they did in 2010. The growth rate increased on average about 76,3% amoung all states. Therefore the overall trend seems to be positiv. Which means there were more guns sold 2016 than in 2010.

Limitations and additional analysis:
The trend is limited to data from 2010 to 2016 and refleced only this period of time. 2016 data includes serveral estimations (e.g. for population). To get a better understanding of recent trends the newest 2020 census data could be used for further analysis.
